# Smart Dustbin using IoT

## Project Overview

The **Smart Dustbin using IoT** is an innovative system designed to automate waste management and encourage more efficient waste disposal practices. This smart system leverages sensors and IoT technology to detect the level of waste in a dustbin, optimize collection schedules, and provide real-time monitoring of waste levels. The project aims to improve cleanliness, reduce waste collection costs, and promote sustainable urban living.

## Features

- **Ultrasonic Sensor for Waste Level Detection**: Measures the level of waste inside the dustbin and triggers alerts when the bin is near full capacity.
- **IoT Integration (Wi-Fi / GSM Module)**: Sends real-time waste level data to a cloud platform, enabling remote monitoring.
- **Automatic Lid Operation**: The dustbin lid opens automatically when it detects the presence of an individual, reducing contact with the dustbin surface.
- **Mobile/Web Dashboard**: Provides real-time data visualization of waste levels and generates notifications for waste collection schedules.
- **Smart Notifications**: Sends alerts to municipal authorities or users when the bin is full or requires maintenance.
- **Power Efficiency**: Equipped with power-saving modes that activate sensors only when needed to reduce energy consumption.

## Components Used

- **ESP32**: The main microcontroller for handling sensor data and sending information to the cloud.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: Used to measure the distance between the sensor and the waste to detect bin fill level.
- **Servo Motor**: Controls the automatic opening and closing of the dustbin lid.
- **Power Supply**: For powering the system components.
- **IoT Platform (Firebase)**: To store and visualize the sensor data in real time.

## How It Works

1. **Waste Level Detection**: The ultrasonic sensor continuously monitors the level of waste inside the dustbin.
2. **Data Transmission**: Once the waste reaches a certain threshold, the microcontroller sends data via the Wi-Fi/GSM module to a cloud server.
3. **Real-Time Monitoring**: The waste level can be monitored in real-time on a mobile/web dashboard, providing an overview of multiple dustbins in a city or community.
4. **Automatic Alerts**: The system triggers alerts when the bin is full, notifying authorities or waste management teams to schedule a collection.
5. **Power Management**: The system remains in low-power mode when idle to ensure long battery life.

## Use Cases

- **Public Spaces**: Smart dustbins can be installed in parks, streets, and public venues to ensure timely waste collection and maintain cleanliness.
- **Smart Cities**: This project fits into the larger concept of smart cities where urban services are automated for greater efficiency.
- **Corporate Offices**: Corporations can install smart dustbins to promote hygiene and reduce waste management costs.
